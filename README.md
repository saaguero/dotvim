Installation
============
1. Copy or symlink vimrc to your `$HOME/.vimrc` (or `%HOMEPATH%` in Windows)
1. If you want to use the same .vimrc for both vim and neovim, copy the file `init.vim` to `$HOME/.config/nvim/`.
  1. You need to adjust the file for Windows.
  1. As of today I mostly use vim, if you use neovim and find something that doesn't work, PR are welcome.
1. Run vim, the first time it will install the package manager `vim-plug` along with all the plugins.

Worth checking my dotfiles that takes care for the above process: https://github.com/saaguero/dotfiles
