Installation
============
1. Copy or symlink .vimrc to your `$HOME` (or `%HOMEPATH%` in Windows)
1. If you want to use the same .vimrc for both vim and neovim, copy the file `init.vim` to `$HOME/.config/nvim/`.
  1. You need to adjust the file for Windows.
  1. As of today I mostly use vim, if you use neovim and find something that doesn't work, please create an issue or PR.
1. Run vim, the first time it will install the package manager `vim-plug` along with all the plugins.
